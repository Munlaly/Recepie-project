<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Even a novice cook can master the art of perfect pizza with our step-by-step guide. This homemade pizza recipe features a simple pizza dough and toppings. </p>
<h2>List of ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>300 g flour</li>
    <li> 1 tsp instant yeap</li>
    <li> 1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
    <li> 1 ml passata</li>
    <li> handful frash basil / 1 tsp dried</li>
    <li> 1 crushed garlic cove</li>
    <li>125 g ball mozzarella</li>
    <li>handful grated parmezan</li>
    <li> handful of cherry tomatoes</li>
    <li> handful of basil leaves</li>
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p> Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt. </p> 
        <p> Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with </p>
        <p> a wooden spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface</p>
        <p> and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside.</p>
         <p> You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.</p>
        </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p> Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together,</p>
         <p>then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.</p></li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p> Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead,</p>
        <p> then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds,</p>
        <p> about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise</p>
        <p>in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p> Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet</p>
        <p> or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.</p>
        <p> Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet,</p>
        <p> on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil</p>
        <p> leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.</p>
