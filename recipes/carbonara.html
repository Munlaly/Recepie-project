<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Spaghetti alla carbonara. Luscious and wonderfully indulgent, pasta carbonara takes as long to make as it does to cook the pasta.</p>
<h2>List of ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
    <li> 1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
    <li> 1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)</li>
    <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
    <li> handful frash basil / 1 tsp dried</li>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
    <li>1Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    
</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p> Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water.</p>
        </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large saut√© pan over medium heat.</p>
        <p>Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.Add the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off</p>
        <p>the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl. </p>
         </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p> When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with</p>
         <p> bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.Move the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly,</p>
         <p>as you want the pasta to be hot. It's the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.</p>
         <p>Toss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn't make the eggs curdle when you mix them in.</p>
         <p>(That's the tricky part.)</p>
    </li>
    <li> <h4>Step</h4> <p>Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta</p>
        <p>to keep it from drying out.Serve at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper. If you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.</p>
