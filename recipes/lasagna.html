<h2>Description</h2>
<p>In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has</p>
<p>an intensely flavored sauce, cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat that’s just chunky </p>
<p>and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.</p>
<h3>List of ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>2 medium red onions, finely diced</li>
    <li>2 large cloves minced garlic</li>
    <li>8 ounces pancetta, diced</li>
    <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1½ cups good red wine, preferably Italian</li>
    <li>228-ounce cans Italian plum tomatoes</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
    <li>¾ pound ground sirloin</li>
    <li>2¼ cups freshly grated Pecorino Romano</li>
    <li>4 eggs</li>
    <li>10 sprigs fresh parsley, leaves only, washed and dried</li>
    <li>2 large whole cloves garlic</li>
    <li>½ cup flour</li>
    <li>1 pound Italian sausage, a mix of hot and sweet</li>
    <li>15-ounce container ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 pound mozzarella, grated</li>
    <li>16 sheets fresh lasagna noodles, preferably Antica Pasteria </li>

</ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<ol>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>For the sauce, heat ½ cup oil in a large heavy Dutch oven or kettle over low heat. </p>
        <p>the onions, minced garlic and pancetta, and cook, stirring, for 10 minutes, until the onions are wilted.</p>
        <p> Season liberally with salt and pepper. Raise heat slightly, add the wine and cook until it is mostly reduced,</p>
        <p> about 20 minutes. Crush the tomatoes into the pan, and add their juice. Add the tomato paste and 2 cups lukewarm water.</p>
        <p> Simmer for 1 hour.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine,</p>
        <p>then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the ingredients</p>
        <p>are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.</p> 
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust the meatballs lightly with flour,</p>
        <p>shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides (do not cook through) and transfer to the sauce.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>In a clean skillet, brown the sausages over medium-high heat. Transfer to the sauce. Simmer 1½ hours.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, Pecorino Romano, parsley and all but</p>
        <p> 1 cup of the mozzarella. Season well with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.</p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Step</h4> <p>Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly, then chop coarsely. </p>
        <p>Spoon a thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles.</p>
        <p> Spoon more sauce on top, then add a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers,</p>
        <p> using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce. Sprinkle reserved</p>
        <p>mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
